## 💡 Key Takeaways (From All Documents)

### The Situation:
```
You have 3 workflows:
  ✅ Awards submissions (working perfectly)
  ⚠️  Awards winner tracking (manual, needs IDs)
  ❌ Surveys (completely manual, 30 hrs/year)
```

### The Options:
```
A. Unified Platform    → $10k, 12 weeks, solves everything ⭐
B. Survey First        → $6k, 10 weeks, surveys only
C. Fix IDs Only        → $2k, 2 weeks, awards improvement only
```

### The Recommendation:
```
Option A (Unified Platform) because:
  • Best long-term value
  • You're already 80% there
  • Perfect timing for spring surveys
  • One login for everything
  • Room to grow
```

### The Timeline:
```
Start:    January 2026
Complete: March 2026 (12 weeks)
Ready:    April 2026 for spring surveys
```

### The Cost:
```
Development: $10,000 (one-time)
Hosting:     $35/month
ROI:         Pays for itself in 4-5 years
Value:       Saves 34+ hours/year + less stress
```
