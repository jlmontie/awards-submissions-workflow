## Three Key Questions

### 1. Do you need surveys by spring 2026?
- **YES** → Choose Option A or B, start January
- **NO** → Option C is fine, add surveys later

### 2. What's your budget?
- **~$10k available** → Option A (best long-term)
- **~$6k available** → Option B (good value)
- **~$2k available** → Option C (solves immediate issue)

### 3. How important is unified platform?
- **Very important** → Option A
- **Nice to have** → Option B
- **Not urgent** → Option C

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option A: Unified Platform**

### Why?
1. You're 80% there (awards system is built)
2. Timing is perfect for spring 2026 surveys
3. One platform = easier to manage
4. Shared infrastructure = lower total cost
5. Easy to add future tools
6. Professional appearance
7. Best ROI over 3+ years

### Risk Mitigation:
- Build in phases (can stop anytime)
- Start with ID fix (quick win)
- Prototype survey before full build
- All code is documented and transferable

---

## Alternative: Survey Prototype

**Not sure? Try this:**

Build a **survey prototype** first:
- **Cost:** $1,000
- **Time:** 1 week
- **Result:** Working demo to evaluate

Then decide if you want the full platform.

---

## What Others Are Doing

### ACI Intermountain Chapter:
- Uses third-party form system (constant contact)
- Less control, ongoing fees
- **UC&D approach is better:** owned system, no per-submission fees

### Industry Trend:
- Moving away from PDF/email workflows
- Web-based submission is standard
- Automated tracking is expected
- **UC&D would be ahead of the curve**
